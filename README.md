**`Student Interactive Media Development @Artevelde University of Applied Sciences`**

Hi, I’m Vik, a student of Interactive Media Development at Artevelde University. I enjoy combining code and creativity to build interactive experiences, from games to AR experiments. In my free time, I love playing football and experimenting in the kitchen with new recipes. Always curious, constantly learning, and always looking for the next exciting digital challenge to tackle.
